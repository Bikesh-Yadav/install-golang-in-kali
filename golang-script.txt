Hello everyone, welcome back to our channel, cybersharks

In this video  you will learn, how to install Golang in Linux system, or say kali Linux. This step is same for all Debian based Linux like kali, parrot or ubuntu also.


this is our kali Linux server where we will install Golang, so lets follow the steps shows in .

first check weather the go lang is installed or not, just by typing this command
since go lang is not installed, we can see the error message shown here.


since Golang is not installed, we will proceed installation process,

lets update he system first, 
it will take some time, so lets fast forward the process.

done, updating is done.

next, lets install Golang by this command.
just press Y, as it will install all required packages. 
it will take some time, so lets fast forward the process.

Done!! Golang installation is done, 

now lets verify again

well, we can see, the lang is already installed.


since we can easily install Golang using option 1, there is no need to proceed, option 2, 
but if you cant install go lang by option 1, you can definitely proceed option 2,

if you again find any issue, feel free to comment.

well, that's it for now,
